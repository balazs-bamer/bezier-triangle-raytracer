# Bézier triangle mesh raytracer

![alt text](./images/intro.jpg "Intro")

The aim of this project is to simulate image rendering of arbitrary-shaped "lenses" described by triangle meshes using Bézier triangle interpolation. It will be possible to simulate free-form lenses, and of course spherical lenses as well. (Of course spherical lenses can be simulated much more efficiently.) This project is just for personal learning, so I omit investigation of existing results.

This work is divided into 4 parts:
1. [C++ utilities and preprocessor](#1001). These parts check the input and produce the Bézier mesh appropriate to implement raytracing.
2. [A single ray tracing implementation in C++](#1002). I use it actually to develop all geometry and raytracing algorithms.

[Shortcomings](#1005) are here. I use Eigen3 for vector calculations and Google Test for unit testing. I also use Sebastian Reiter's STL reader utility to parse STL files.

[Here](https://db.bme.hu/~bamer/tdk/TDK.html) is my ancient naive implementation of spherical lens system simulator from 1994-1998 (in Hungarian). That work originates from the high school with most parts ready then. I've abandoned the work because a 80386 without an FPU was far too slow for any meaningful rendering. During the university I could complete it and use a Sun workstation for rendering the images.

## C++ utilities and preprocessor

<a id="1001">For</a> space and performance reasons, I use 3D Cartesian coordinates. Since most container sizes are known or calculable, I use `std::vector`s for simple storage.

### src/util.h

This file contain common type declarations for all other sources, some geometry calculations like plane creatian and intersection, triangle altitudes. There is also a simple uniform triangle subdivision function template.

### src/mesh.h

This is the home of the `Mesh` class. I know there are several good STL and mesh processing libraries, but I've created this class for three reasons:
1. I wanted full control over mesh processing.
2. I wanted to preserve original vertices. If the mesh creation algorithm is sophisticated enough, it knows better where and how to place vertices. Any postprocessing can only make it worse.
3. It contains important preprocessing steps for later stages, which belong to triangle mesh processing, not Bézier triangle meshes.
4. I enjoy working with geometry vectors.

The `Mesh` class exposes a set of STL vector-like interface functions for easier use. It also provides overloaded operators for displace and inflate operations, STL file I/O. Here I only write about the more interesting functions.
Note, this class can only handle a mesh consisting of **exactly one totally filled** shape.

#### Mesh::standardizeVertices

This function is used to make vertices of different triangles coincide when they are practically the same mesh vertex, but have sightly different values from different numeric errors. This will enable later functions to compare floating point values for identity check. Note, these comparisons only occur on output of this function without any subsequent calculations. Here first I calculate an epsilon value for proximity comparisons using the smallest triangle length. Since the naive implementation would be O(n^2), a more sophisticated algorithm is needed.

I solve the problem using 1D projections. For each dimension, I take the vertices in ascending order and group them based on if they are closer to each other than epsilon. Pairwise proximity check will then only be needed in each group. I take the dimension where the maximum groups size is minimal (less degenerate projection) and then perform the pairwise check. I adjust each vertex pair to the smaller one according to an artificial alphabetical ordering of the coordinates.

#### Mesh::standardizeNormals

This function makes all triangle normals point outwards if calculated as `(triangle[1] - triangle[0]).cross(triangle[2] - triangle[0])` (note: `using Triangle = std::array<Vertex, 3u>`). This funtion must be used after `Mesh::standardizeVertices`, and assumes that there is no triangle vertex on the side of an other triangle. The algorithm is roughly
1. Find a vertex with the smallest X coordinate.
2. Find a neighbouring triangle with the smallest x component (negative for all such triangles).
3. Make this triangle good by possibly swapping two vertices.
4. Create a set of triangles with the side neighbours of this initial triangle, marking their known good neighbour as well.
5. Take a triangle from the set, make it good using the info from its known neighbour.
6. Put its unprocessed neighbours to the set.
7. Loop to 5. if the sset is not empty.

This function also gathers auxiliary data for later stages, see below.

#### Mesh::makeEllipsoid(int32_t const aSectors, int32_t const aBelts, Vector const &aSize)

Deletes all current contents and creates an ellipsoid with the given parameters. The triangle vertices will be on the ellipsoid surface. The ellipsoid is approximated somewhat similarly as the azimuth-inclination mesh on the Earth. There will be `aBelts` pieces of "belts" along each "parallel", each divided evenly by `aSectors` vertices. Between the belts there are 2 * `aSectors` pieces of triangles, while between the extreme belts and poles only `aSectors` pieces. The parameter aSize contains the principal semi-axes of the ellipsoid. There is also a special case called `makeUnitSphere` to create a unit sphere.

#### Mesh::getFace2neighbours

Returns an `std::vector<Neighbours>`, each item corresponding to a mesh triangle. Here the struct `Neighbours` holds information about the neighbouring triangles of the aactual one's each side (starting at vertex i within the triangle):
* mFellowTriangles for mesh index of the neighbour of the actual side (`i` -> `(i+1)%3`)
* mFellowCommonSideStarts for the vertex index `k` in each fellow triangle where the common side starts such that the side in the neighbouring triangle (`k` -> `(k+1)%3`) is the same side as (`i` -> `(i+1)%3`).
Must be run after `Mesh::standardizeNormals`.

#### Mesh::getVertex2averageNormals

Returns a map of vertices to the "vertice normals", which will be the Bézier triangle normals in the vertices. "Vertex normals" are the weighted average of triangle normals containing the vertex, weighted by the triangle angles at thaty vertex. Must be run after `Mesh::standardizeNormals`. Perhaps it would be important to implement a way to import these values along with the triangles when the original surface is known and dervatives are present. This would enable much more exact approximation.

### src/bezierTriangle.h

Here resides the `BézierTriangle` class which is capable of
* Creating a Bézier triangle over a regular triangle, considering its neighbours, in a way that the neighbouring Bézier surfaces will give a surface with C1 continuity. [[1]](#1) I chosed C1 because cubic Bézier triangles are sufficient for this, and the interpolation and thus the surface intersection calculations will be faster.
* Linear interpolation on the underlying planar triangle using barycentric coordinates within the underlying triangle.
* Bézier interpolation using barycentric coordinates within the underlying triangle.
* Ray and underlying planar triangle intersection with barycentric output.
* Ray and Bézier triangle intersection with barycentric output.
* Normal vector calculation on the barycentric triangle using barycentric coordinates.

The Bézier triangle will contain all the original triangle vertices. Control point calculations follow [[1]](#1) with the details figured out by myself where the paper was not specific. There are 3 `constexpr` parameters influencing control point placement, which were empirically estimated TODO see where
TODO perhaps write control point calculation in detail.

The class contains some precomputed values useful for intersection calculations, like maximum distances from the underlying triangle inside and outside.

#### BezierTriangle::intersectByBezierEvaluations

This is my old intersection function.

Theres is no closed formula for Bézier triangle and ray intersection, like there is for planes and spheres. There are existing ray - Bézier triangle intersection algorithms, such as [[2]](#2). The article does not contain performance data, and it seemed to me a big effort to implement it. So I've found out a rather simple algorithm based on Newton's method with one or two identical computation-intensive loops, which are easy to run parallel for many rays.

First I check the intersection with the underlying planar triangle, and if it intersects, calculate the lengths along the ray measured from its starting point
* until the ray reaches the signed distance from the underlying plane equal to the maximal surface point above that plane
* until the ray reaches the signed distance from the underlying plane equal to the maximal surface point below that plane

The intersection calculation is performed in a fixed number of iterations, currently 4.

1. Set starting point the linear estimation of the ray and surface intersection based on their distance difference from the underlying plane at the above extremes. This is a point on the ray. If the point would fall too far away or division by zero would occur, I take the extremes interval midpoint. TODO figure.
2. Set the initial projection direction to the underlying triangle normal.
3. Project the candidate point on ray to the underlying plane in the projection direction. TODO figure.
4. Calculate its barycentric coordinates.
5. Use these to calculate the corresponding surface point and surface normal.
6. Set the new projection direction to the surface point - projected point vector. This greatly reduces the approximation error.
7. Take the plane in the surface point perpendicular to the surface normal and intersect it with the ray to get the next ray point to start from.
8. Goto 3 when there is iteration left.

This process is practically a modification of Newton's root finding method, with an indirect way of evaluating f(x) and f'(x) - exact calculation does not work without barycentric coordinates. The process practically always converges, when the ray has not too big angle of incidence, with an indirect way of evaluating f(x) and f'(x) - exact calculation does not work without barycentric coordinates. The process practically always converges, when the ray has not too big angle of incidence. TODO exact proof for this based on [[3]](#3)

When ready, it is important to check if the intersection is within the domain of the current Bézier triangle. If not, the intersection would be more accurate when calculated on the appropriate neighbouring triangle. To enable this, in this case I return the side index to be considered for a similar calculation process for the neighbouring triangle. Since its planar intersection will definitely be outside the underlying triangle, I omit that check to let the function finish. TODO figures.

Following from the algorithm, the intersection point will lie exactly on the Bézier surface. The relative accuracy of the intersection (so the distance of the intersection point from the ray, normalized by the shape size) is usually **3e-6**, but in the rare cases of bias divergence it can be as high as **2e-4**.

#### BezierTriangle::intersectKajiya

This is a faster and more precise alternative to the previous method, based on the idea of [[10]](#10). It uses the same early-out, planar triangle limit and neighbour classification steps.

The cubic Bézier triangle `S(u, v)` (with `u` and `v` the first two barycentric coordinates) is precomputed in power basis as `S(u, v) = Σ A_ij u^i v^j` for `i + j <= 3`, so its partial derivatives `S_u` and `S_v` are quadratic polynomials with coefficients readily available from the same 10 vectors `A_ij`.

The ray `o + t d` is regarded as the intersection of two planes containing it. Their normals `n1` and `n2` are perpendicular to `d` and to each other, so the planes are parallel to the ray and meet exactly in it. A surface point lies on the ray when it lies on both planes:

`f1(u, v) = n1 · S(u, v) - n1 · o = 0`  
`f2(u, v) = n2 · S(u, v) - n2 · o = 0`

Projecting the coefficients `A_ij` onto `n1` and `n2` once per ray gives two scalar cubic polynomials. Then a 2D Newton iteration solves the system for `(u, v)` using the 2x2 Jacobian `[[n1 · S_u, n1 · S_v], [n2 · S_u, n2 · S_v]]`, starting from the barycentric coordinates of the planar intersection. Each iteration is only scalar polynomial evaluation, without normalization or cross products. The intersection is accepted only when the Newton step becomes negligible. Finally the surface point `S(u, v)`, the ray parameter `t = d · (S(u, v) - o)` and the normal `S_u × S_v` are calculated once.

A direct Newton iteration on the single ray parameter `t` would need the implicit equation of the Bézier triangle, which is of degree 9 with 220 coefficients, numerically fragile and also has roots outside the triangle.

#### BezierTriangle::getNormal

This function is used in `BezierTriangle::intersectByBezierEvaluations` to calculate the surface normal in the intersection point. I used the principle described in [[4]](#4) to calculate closed-formula barycentric derivatives and use them to calculate two perpendicular surface tangent directions in that point. Their cross product gives the desired normal.

### src/bezierMesh.h

The `BezierMesh` class is similar to and based on the `Mesh` class, and is responsible of
* Constructing the Bézier triangle mesh of `BézierTriangle` instances in Clough-Tocher subdivision [[1]](#1), see later. Input is plain triangle `Mesh`.
* Obtaining a triangular mesh approximation (`interpolate`) with evenly subdividing each subtriangle side into `aDivisor` parts.
* Split "thick" Bézier triangles into smaller, "thinner" ones.

#### BezierMesh::splitThickBezierTriangles

I've implemented this function because the raytracing will inspect mesh and ray intersections using the underlying triangle mesh (after Clough-Tocher subdivision). When we have the planar intersection, it will be used to calculate the ray intersection with the Bézier triangle above it. However, if the Bézier triangle forms a relatively too "tall" dome above the underlying triangle, it is more likely a ray can travel through it without intersecting any planar triangle. Of course it is still possible when the Bézier triangles are "close" to the underlying triangles, but much less likely. In such a rare case, the simulation will find the ray pass just right beside the object.

The idea here is to take all Bézier triangles, and subdivide each one proven to be too tall. Note, as we are in the Bézier triangle domain, each triangle is the reasult of the Clough-Tocher subdivision. I could have gone with taking that subdivision of the tall triangle, but it tends to create "thin" triangles, as the edges won't ever be split. I know there are well-known subdivision algorithm, but I wanted to make a very simple implementation and take advantage of the Bézier triangle control point information, which already takes into account the neighbouring triangles.

Curently I take the approximate Bézier triangle height (maximum at the original triangle centroid and quarter points of the original sides) and the triangle perimeter ratio, and if it is larger than a constant, I will split it. It might be interesting to incorporate an absolute value parameter too.

The algorithm is simple: I take the underlying side midpoints of a "tall" Bézier triangle, and divide it into 4 pieces. Now it creates vertices where the neighbouring triangle may not have on (no need to split it), so I propagate the subdivision info across each edge to the neighbouring triangle, and split them accordingly into 2 or 3 pieces, for 1 or 2 neighbours being subdivided, respectively. TODO figures.

New (dividing) vertices are calculated as a fixed linear combination of the side midpoint of the underlying triangle edge and the Bézier interpolation of that point (which is "above" the underlying triangle). The linear combination factor has been found out empirically, see below. The function gives back a new finer `Mesh` instance, which then needs to be preprocessed again and used in creation of a new, finer `BézierMesh`.

#### BezierMesh::intersect

This is now only a simple brute-force search for the intersection giving the shortest ray.

#### Ellipse approximation test

I've chosen an ellipsoid with principal semi-axes 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 was used for these tests. I've chosen this shape because it somewhat resembles a lens, has curvatures with reasonably high variety in radii. I've measured the error of the interpolated mesh (`aDivisor` == 3) vertices relative to the ellipsoid surface point in the very same direction (where the line containing the center and the vertex intersects the ellipsoid). Average quadratic relative errors were between **1.9e-5** and **2.2e-3** for the same tuned parameters.
I find these results good enough to start with. Should the error be too big for some application, a more specialized parameter tuning is possible or I might use more sophiticated preprocessing algorithms.
There are general error limits for surface approximation using Bézier triangles like in [[5]](#5). Here for any triangle where the parametric function describing the surface to approximate is known and its second partial derivatives exist, an upper limit for the error can be expressed.

## C++ raytracer

<a id="1002">This</a> is just visualization for visual inspection in Blender.

### src/bezierLens.h

`BezierLens` now only contains the function below. The class is constructed with the refractive index and the `BezierMesh` giving its shape.

#### BezierLens::refract

This is a simple implementation using relative indices of refraction according to [[6]](#6). Refraction only occurs if the ray intersects the contained shape, and handles inside-outside and outside-inside transitions automatically. To avoid uncertain intersections with large angles of incidence, the method accepts the expected "place" of ray (inside or outside). Should the intersection result be different, the method interpets it as no intersection. As Bézier surfaces allow quite precise normal calculation, the refraction precision depends on
- the surface approximation using the Bézier triangle mesh
- the intersection precision.

## Shortcomings

<a id="1005">In</a> theory, my algorithms can handle concave meshes, and the `Mesh` class even meshes with holes in it (with hole walls covered by triangles, so holes in topological sense). In practice I've tried some concave bodies, and the ones with small face angles (< 90-120 degrees, depending on the situation) cause numeric errors, most probably because the extreme variation between sizes of neighbouring triangles and sharp edges.

Both intersection algorithms miss more and more mesh intersections as the angle of incidence grows, because they start from the intersection with the underlying planar triangle and follow at most one neighbour. The limit depends on the mesh density. On a coarse 7x3 unit sphere about 90% of the intersections are found at 60 degrees and 60% at 70 degrees. On a finer 21x15 unit sphere practically all are found up to 75 degrees, 85% at 80 degrees and 45% at 86 degrees. This could be fixed with some shallow recursion, but I leave it yet.

Analysis of the old intersection algorithm lacks exact mathematical proof. The new one is based on Kajiya's algorithm, which is mathematically well founded,

The refraction algorithm does not handle compound lenses.
